    replace: "After you download and install Hivello, the app will automatically start contributing to the DePIN protocols and you can start earning once you activate the available projects/protocols (DePINs) on the “Network” tab. Currently the app is supporting 3 amazing projects: Mysterium, Sia and Livepeer. Firstly, we recommend you add your bank account or wallet details to ensure secure and smooth payouts. To complete this step, please navigate to the “Wallet” tab in the app. Please have your account number, SWIFT code, account name and bank name handy to complete the process as fast as possible. Now, get ready to install your preferred DePIN nodes, in other words, connect to at least one of the available web3 projects. To do so, please navigate to the “Networks” tab. Here, you can select projects/DePIN nodes like Sia from the “File storage network”, or Mysterium and Livepeer from the “Compute” network. Click on the project and click on the “Install” button. To maximize your earning potential, we recommend you connect to all available networks and run the app as frequently as you can (even 24/7)."
